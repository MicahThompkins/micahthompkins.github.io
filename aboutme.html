      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p1>Hello! My name is Micah Thompkins. I am a senior studying computer science at Northwestern University with a focus on software development.

I am an ultimate frisbee player, who loves to bike, play video games, play any and every board and card game, read books, take and make photos, and watch and discuss movies.

I am interested in several different CS fields currently. From software development, to mobile development, to computer security, and finally full stack development. Most fields within computer science currently interest me. </p>
