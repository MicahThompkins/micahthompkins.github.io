For this project I used Python 3, working within virtual environments and creating code that could be downloaded and ran on any machine through use of a pip requirements file. The scanner utilizes command line tools to do most of itâ€™s lookups, and if the host machine is missing one of those command line tools the scanner still operates with graceful error handling.", "TCP description"]
